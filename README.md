This assignment involves creating a Python script to analyze server log files and extract meaningful insights. The script processes the logs to count requests per IP address, identify the most frequently accessed endpoint, and detect suspicious activities such as potential brute force attacks based on failed login attempts. It exhibits competence in data analysis, handling files, and string parsing while putting an emphasis on clearly arranging the findings. By applying this into practice, we can identify use trends, keep an eye on system activity, and identify possible security risksâ€”all of which are essential competencies for positions in system monitoring and cybersecurity.
